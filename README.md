## Functional Requirements

	Funcional metronome that produces a sound and animation for a user to use for keeping a beat
	User can adjust BPM, time signature: updates in real time
	Metronome can be played in the background and can be paused/played/stopped
	Metronome can be represented as different animations
	Metronome can be set as progressive: meaning that it can increase/decrease in speed
		User can adjust the settings of progression
	Settings are persisted on device
	Must work on iPhone at least
	User can create a set routine for practice (need to work out details)
		But maybe something like "play 5 bars of quarter notes then 10 bars of 16th notes" or something similar
	User can tap to create/adjust beat
	User creates the experience they want

	Allow user to create new metronome setting for others to use
	Integration with spotify/apple music (may not be possible)
		Allow beat detetion/look up
	Insert ads
	Integrate specific instruments into metronome

	Allow multiple metronomes? Is this something possible or even desired?
	Possibly allow for user profiles
	Run on iPad, and Apple Watch also
		Watch could have some unique metronome animations/vibrations
